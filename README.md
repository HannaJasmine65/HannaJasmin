Hello there! This is Hanna Jasmin. This repository contains a short note on technolgies that interest me and two python codes to print the given patterns.

  
## New Technology
* **AI applications**:
</p>
<div class=text-justify> 
Most of us interact with AI on a daily basis, without knowing it. From something as common as  creating music, songs, games, etc. to being increasingly active in emerging technology such as "edge" computing, AI has transformed technology like never before. Major industries are also rushing towards embracing AI trends in order to create more efficient, faster results with the large amount of data produced by consumers. AI, being very versatile, accomodates not just computer-related domains, but also spaces such as security, healthcare, banking, clothing, etc. AI-optimised hardware and robotics will soon work much more efficiently with the ability to accommodate AI/Machine learning.Such services would soon prove to be useful assets for people and complement human abilities to enhance their functionality. Studying the changing trends and being in the ever-evolving loop is critical to be a part of this "coming-of-age" transformation.

 * **NLP**: 
</p>
<div class=text-justify> 
The final year of my Bachelor of Technology in Engineering was spent working on creating a Malayalam speech recognizer that opened up the world of Natural Language Processing and its vast applications. NLP is an approach to process, analyze and understand large amount of text data. Though quite old in the roots, NLP is an active part of data science field and is our present and future! The amount of data we deal with and produce daily iss HUGE in numbers. The data is also unstructured in most social applications. Developing proper tools that can efficiently process such huge chunks of dats along with structing data is essential at present. Speech translation, speech recognition, speaker idenitification, speaker authentication, real-time chatbots,  sentimental analysis, grammar and spell checking, TTS and STT, text classification and object recogniton are some outstanding and reasearch fields. Building such systems with accuracy can help us work across domains, cultures, languages and geographical barriers with ease like never before. NLP has changed the way we interact with computers and will continue to do so in the future. NLP is already here and the prospects are very exiciting.

* **Cloud computing, Edge computing and Distributed cloud computing**: 
</p>
<div class=text-justify> 
 Over the years, cloud computing has seen unparalleled growth with industries and companies investing heavily in the same. Though on-demand computing, storage and network-provisioning, cloud computing has helped in the digital transformation of organisation. Edge computing differs from cloud computing and the both are not interchangeable. Edge computing is used to process time-sensitive data, while cloud computing is used to process data that is not time-driven. Security, time, cost and the rapid growth of IoT are the major factors being the successful take-off of Edge computing. We should also keep in mind that Edge computing will soon form the key to the on-set of 5G and IoT-based services. The movemenet from centralized to decentralized cloud computing methods brings us to the future of Distributed cloud computing. A complementary aspect of Edge computing,it maintains centralized-control while working across physical and geographical barriers. Trends around cloud computing are constantly being updated and evolving.

* **Blockchain**: 
</p>
<div class=text-justify> 
  For a while the first thing that popped up in one's mind on hearing "blockchain" was the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. However, Blockchain has applications in both financial and non-financial applications. Some financial application include sata storage, currency tranfer, pgp tranfser, gaming, platform sharing,etc. And the non-financial applications include authentication,digital identity, app developement, authentication, IoT, etc. The property of adding the chain of data and never removing or modifying the previous links or blocks is what makes a Blockchain so secure.  The goal of blockchain is to allow digital information to be recorded and distributed, but not edited. Improved accuracy is obtained by removing human involvement in verification step while trsut and security are enhanced by removing third-parties such as governemnt. Privacy, security and transperancy are three things to look forward to and appreciate in any technology and Blockchain makes this possible.
